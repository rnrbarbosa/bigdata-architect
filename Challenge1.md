# Challenge 1

## Situation


>We need to build a tracking API for our apps. We expect to receive 1.000.000 requests per second. These collected data will be consumed in two ways:
>* by several microservices, which must respond to requests like to retrieve all the events from a user, allowing filtering by date or type of the event.		
>* for report generation and analytics, aggregating over users groups, event types by day and product categories.
>

## Task

>Choose the different technologies and draw diagrams for the 
architecture for the API, the persistence system and the data model.
